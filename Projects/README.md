## Flower_Image_Classifier
The project link is: https://github.com/hyw1994/Flower_Image_Classifier

In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch for 102 flower categories, then convert it into a command line application.

The project is combined with 3 parts:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset;
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset;
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content;
